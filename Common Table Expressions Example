# Created a Common Table Expression to calculate the total amount paid by each customer and included nested subqueries to filter the cities and countries with highest number of customers 
which limited the results to the 10 top cities within the top 10 countries, and finally I selected the average of total amounts paid by the 5 customers from the average amount CTE.
