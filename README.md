# SQL-Rockbuster-Stealth-Data-Analysis-Project

# Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC i s a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service i n order to stay competitive. The first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then,  use SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.

# Key Questions and Objectives

# Data set used
The data set includes information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, payments, countries, stores, staff, films, genres, actors, rental history and addresses, among other things. The first task was to  load the data set into the PostgreSQL database. Postgre SQL was solely used for the the purpose of this analysis.
